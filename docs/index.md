Maestro was created to enable genomic researchers to enhance their Overture [SONG](https://www.overture.bio/products/song)
by building search indexes, Elasticsearch by default, that makes searching Analyses and Studies much more powerful and easier.
Created indexes are then easy to integrate with [Arranger](https://www.overture.bio/products/arranger)
